# Reclaim The Light

## **Overview**

Reclaim The Light is a text based adventure game that includes PVE elements. It is loosly based on the Destiny Universe and this is where I drew my inspiration the project.

The game is aimed at every audience but may be enjoyed alot more by the older generations who grew up with text adventure games and fans of the Destiny universe.

Developed by Sean Finn.

## **Project Goals**

This is my third portfolio project for [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) and my goal with this project is to display my newly acquired Python skills. I decided to build a classic text based adeventure game that included some PvE battle elements. The adventure is led by the players choices and each choice has an impact on how the story progresses.

## **How to Play**

Reclaim The Light is a very easy game to play, all the player needs to do is input letters that correspond to the the choices provided to the player. The player's goal is to retrieve the Light cyrstal that was stolen by the evil creatures known as the Darkness. The Player will be sent on an adventure to the planet Nessus to fight the Darkness and Reclaim The Light.

### ***Setup Phase:***

The player will be asked for their name and be requested to pick a class for their "Guardian", the classes are "W" for "Warrior" , "A" for "Assasin" or "M" for "Mage". After that they will shown a screen containing their Guardian stats.

### ***How to Win:***

The player will make choices that will lead them into battles on occasion, if the players survives they will move on to the next part of the adventure leading to a boss battle at the end. If they defeat the boss they will Reclaim The Light and win the game. 

## **User Stories:**
As a user, I want to be able to:
* Understand the aim of the story.
* Have a straightforward way to read the game instructions from within.
* To access a fun engaging story narrative throughout the game.
* Find loot and upgrade stats.

## **Features**

### **Welcome Screen**
The user is met with a bright Welcome Screen with some colored ascii text to provide an asthectically pleasing experience. There are 3 options to choose from Start, Mission Log or About.
![Welcome Screen](/docs/screenshots/welcome.webp)

### **Mission Log**
`
User Story: As a user, I want to be able to understand the aim of the story.
`

The Mission Log provides the user with the backstory and the aim of the game. It is displayed to the user using the type print animation followed up with the pause function imported from the py-getch Library. This allows the user to take their time reviewing the Mission Log text before pressing any key to return to Welcome Screen.
![Mission Log](/docs/screenshots/mission_log.webp)
### **About**
`
User Story: As a user, I want to have a straightforward way to read the game instructions from within.
`

The About section provide the user with details of what the game is and the instructions for the game. There is also a section that provides information on each Guardian class Warrior, Assassin or Mage. This will give the user a better idea on what class they would like to pick for the game.
![About](/docs/screenshots/about.webp)

### **Start**

When the user selects Start they will be brought to a screen with some bright ascii text welcoming them to the game. They will then be prompted to enter a name for their Guardian which consists of only letters and numbers. The user upon completing that stage will be prompted to select 1 of the 3 possible classes provided Warrior, Assassin or Mage. After the user completes that step they will see the text - "Generating Guardian"
![About](/docs/screenshots/setup.webp)

### **Stats**

When the user has completed the Start setup they will be provided with a screen that displays some wepaon related ascii art along with their Guardian stats. The stats consist of 6 values (Attack, Defense, Health, Luck, Magic and Range) followed by the users name. The stats are generated based off the class chosen by the the user i.e. If they choose Mage the Magic stat will be higher compared to the other classes. The only stat that doesnt have a set value is the Luck stat which is generated within the gen_char() function and is setup to be a random value between 1 & 10.

## Features

### Highscores

The Highscores page can be accessed via the Highscores button on the homepage of the website, when clicked it will display the users Highscores and give the option to return Home, Play Quiz or Clear Highscores. I was in 2 minds whether to include the Clear Highscores button but from speaking to class mates/family/mentor majority feedback was that they were happy to have it there. 
![Desktop Highscores](/docs/readme/features/desktop-highscores.PNG)

### Instructions Modal

The Instructions Modal can be accessed via the Instructions button on the homepage of the website, when clicked it will display the instructions for the quiz and advise the user that local storage will be used to store Highscores. The user can close the modal by clicking on the "X" icon displayed at the top of the modal or can click anywhere outside the modal space.
![Desktop Instructions Modal](/docs/readme/features/desktop-instructions.PNG)

### Sign Up/Feedback

The Sign Up/Feedback section is available on the homepage, it allows the user to sign up for the site newsletter and offer their feedback on the site/quiz.
![Desktop Signup](/docs/readme/features/desktop-signup.PNG)

### Footer

The footer is placed at the bottom of the page. It contains the social media links displayed with icons provided by Font Awesome. There is also a small portion of text for the Copyright/Disclaimer. This is where the user can click on a social media link and reach out to the developer for news and updates.
![Desktop Footer](/docs/readme/features/desktop-footer.PNG)

### Quiz

The Quiz content can be accessed from the "Let's get started ->" button on the Homepage. There is a custom loader in place that will hide when the quiz is ready. The quiz features a timer, sound effects which can be toggled on/off (sound toggled off as standard), a progress bar/text, questions, answers, and a check answer button. The timer is set to 90 seconds, if the user does not answer the 10 questions in the allocated time the quiz will automatically finish. There is a sound effect for the correct answer, incorrect answer, and click when selecting an answer. The progress bar/text are both dynamic and update with each question asked. The questions and answers are fetched from the Opentdb API to allow for more replayability. As a design choice, I wanted a check answer button instead of just displaying the correct answer instantly, the reason for this is I found that a user may click an answer they didn't want sometimes by mistake, and at least with the check answer button it should remedy that situation. When the user does click on an answer and then selects the "CHECK ANSWER" button the button hides and the result appears in its place. The correct answer will be signified with green background and text confirming Correct Answer. When the answer selected is incorrect the result will be signified with a red background and text confirming Incorrect Answer and text signifying what the correct answer was. If the user doesn't click on an answer and then selects the "CHECK ANSWER" button the result area will display briefly the following text "Please select an answer!".

![Desktop Quiz Select Answer](/docs/readme/features/desktop-quiz-check.PNG)

### End of Quiz

When the user has finished the quiz the results will display. If the user has not answered any questions correctly the username entry will be hidden and they will be instructed to Play Again to get their name on the Leaderboard. If the user does answer some questions correctly their results will be shown along with a message and movie quote - these will change based on users' results. They will now be able to enter a username - there is an indication to tell the user that their username needs to be between 4 and 10 characters with no spaces (spaces have been disabled in the code). If the user enters less than 4 characters or more than 10 and try's to save the Save button will be disabled, if the user enters a username between 4 & 10 characters the indication text will hide, and user can save their username. When the user saves their username they will be redirected to the Highscores page.

#### Lighthouse errors

At Mobile, the Performance score is between 95-100 - This is due to Cumulative Layout Shift. As the site is setup to move dynamically depending on what should be displayed this is the highest score achievable at the moment, in future I will look to see what else can be done.

### Further Testing

The site was scaled from a width of 320px in Chrome Dev Tools to check that the site was responsive. There were no apparent issues but it is worth mentioning that the site was built with Portrait orientation in mind but user can view in Landscape although there would be some scrolling to do which would be expected. I found a site called browserstack.com that simulated some of the most recent mobile phones and I just tested the quiz output on a variety of devices - again this is a simulation in the lines of the Dev Tools offered by chrome.

### Testing User Stories from the User Experience (UX) Section

- #### First Time Visitor Goals

    -   As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site.
        - Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean homepage with site logo.
        - The user will be able to understand what the site is about with the text that appears under the logo.
    -   As a First Time Visitor, I want to understand the rules of the quiz.
        - The user will be greeted with some descriptive text of the quiz but there is also an Instructions button that the user can access that goes into further detail on the quiz.
    -   As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to view the site on multiple devices.
        - I have applied media queries to allow the site to function responsively across multiple devices.

- #### Returning Visitor Goals

    -   As a Returning Visitor, I want to see new questions.
        - The quiz has been setup to fetch questions from the Opentdb API so the user should see new questions when playing again.
    -   As a Returning Visitor, I want to learn more about any updates.
        - There is a sign up section included on the site, by signing up the user will be registered for the site newsletter which will include news on future updates to the site and any new content released.
    -   As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the site developer.
        - The user can sign up and offer their feedback on the site, alternatively they can contact the developer via the social media links provided in the footer. 

-   #### Frequent User Goals

    -   As a Frequent User, I want to be able to view my best scores
        - The site contains a highscores page containing a Leaderboard. The quiz is setup to store the users Quiz scores via local storage of the users device.
    -   As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new sections added to the site.
        - The user would already be familiar with the website layout and would be able to navigate the site to see if new sections have been added.
    -   As a Frequent User, I want to sign up so that I am emailed any major updates and/or changes to the website.
        - If user signs up they will receive a newsletter containing updates.

### Bugs and Fixes

<details><summary>Bug - User receiving Incorrect result after selecting Correct Answer.</summary>

When questions were fetched from the API special characters were causing an issue when the user would select the correct answer they would get the incorrect result.
![Question Bug](/docs/readme/bugs/question-bug.PNG)
![Question Bug Reason](/docs/readme/bugs/question-bug-reason.PNG)

Fix - Upon researching this issue, I was able to resolve this by taking a function from a GeekProbin video to decode the Html of the correct answer and just display the plain text.
</details>

<details><summary>Bug - At end page browser/mobile back button not reloading quiz</summary>

When the user was on the end of quiz results page they are indicated to enter a username if they score more then 0 or if 0 they are indicated to play again. There is a play again button that would direct them back to the quiz page and all worked as expected but if the user was to click the browser/mobile back button instead the quiz would start again but would not be reloaded to its original state. This caused the amount of questions to go over what was expected and the progress bar width grew outside its container. The problem was not evident in VS Code and could not be replicated there so several commits where done in the testing period to try and resolve.
![End Page Bug](/docs/readme/bugs/endpage-bug.png)

Fix - After numerous attempts and a lot of commits testing various code to try and override/change the back button behavior I decided to remove the endpage.html and implement all the code into the quiz.html. I set the end page section to hidden and revealed it with javascript code at the time required. Now when a user presses the browser/mobile back button they are brought back to the homepage instead of the quiz.

<details><summary>Bug - Mobile Lighthouse Performance</summary>

Maybe technically not a bug but when the quiz was created and styled I ran my lighthouse checks, on desktop I was getting 100% in Performance but on mobile Performance was between 60%-70%.
![Mobile Performance](/docs/readme/bugs/mobile-lighthouse-bug.png)

Fix - To increase Performance there were several actions I made:
1. Removed Font Awesome script in Header and placed at end of body.
2. Added the following to the Head - link rel="preconnect" href="https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=10&category=11&type=multiple"
3. Removed the global media queries css file and placed the required css into the quiz.css file.
4. Removed the mediaqueries.css link from the head
5. Went through the css and removed or altered css that was not need or was duplicated for some properties.
6. Reduced margins of the quiz container. Gave some specific widths to elements.
7. Added favicon to remove console errors.

<details><summary>Bug - API Fetch Issues</summary>

Originally I had the quiz setup to fetch 10 questions and display 1 at a time. I quickly noticed from testing and feedback that there was a small delay between each question as instead of displaying the next question of the 10 fetched it was fetching 10 questions each time.

Fix - To resolve this issue I had watched a James Q Quick video on fetching from an API and took some of the code he had written and applied it to the quiz I had setup. It took awhile to understand the API call but after hours of testing and gaining knowledge it now fetches the 10 questions only once and displays each question from the 10 fetched without delays.

Another issue that came up in testing and from feedback was that the user was sometimes seeing the same question in the same instance of a quiz i.e. 2 of the 10 questions in one game were the same

Fix - To resolve this I simply removed the question that was displayed from the questions array using splice - availableQuestions.splice(questionIndex, 1);

<details><summary>Bug - Username Input Issues</summary>

Originally I had the input function set to "keyup" event and all seemed well until a class mate noticed that the "Save" button was disabled when they tried to copy and paste their username in.

Fix - To resolve this issue I changed the "keyup" event to "input" and user was now able to copy and paste.

I noticed with testing the user could enter 4 blank spaces as a username and was able to save. This caused the Leaderboard to look bad with no names showing.

Fix - To resolved I disabled spaces in the input field and added some instruction text under the input field for the user to review.

## Future Updates

I would like to add the following updates in the future when time permits:

1. Global Leaderboard - Instead of scores being saved locally on the user's device they would instead be saved to a database where every user's score would be stored.
2. Categories - I would like to add specific Movie categories like Action, Comedy, Thriller, Sci-Fi, etc.
3. Difficulty Levels - I would like to incorporate difficulty levels like Easy, Medium & Hard.
4. Remaining Time added to the overall score - I want the timer to be more of just a countdown and have more influence on the overall score i.e. Answering correctly faster adds more points to the score.

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the repository [P2-Movie-Buff-Or-Bluff](https://github.com/seanf316/P2-Movie-Buff-Or-Bluff)
2. At the top of the Repository (not the top of the page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "Pages" Section on the left side of the page. Click "Pages".
4. In the "Pages" section under "Source" there is a "Branch" section, click the dropdown called "None" select "main" and click save.
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://seanf316.github.io/P2-Movie-Buff-Or-Bluff/) in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Version Control

For version control the following steps were made:

1. Changes made to files in Gitpod
2. Files made ready for commit with command - git add .
3. For the commits the following command was run along with commit description - git commit -m "This is my commit etc"
4. To move the changes to Github the following command was run - git push  

Please note due to a bug that could not be replicated locally there were a series of commits made to test resolution of bug via published link. - (At end page browser/mobile back button not reloading quiz)

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the repository [P2-Movie-Buff-Or-Bluff](https://github.com/seanf316/P2-Movie-Buff-Or-Bluff)
2. At the top of the Repository (not the top of the page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

1. [Code Institute Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template)
    - This repository was created using the template provided by Code Institute. Also, without the knowledge gained through the course work, I would not be able to create this site so thank you Code Institute.
1. [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
    - W3schools was used throughout the project process for answering any queries I had.
1. [James Q Quick](https://www.youtube.com/c/JamesQQuick), [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob), [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/c/WebDevSimplified), [Code with Ania Kubów](https://www.youtube.com/c/AniaKub%C3%B3w), [Brian Design](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsKsymTY_4BYR-wytLjex7A).
    - All of the above for creating fantastic videos on HTML/CSS & Javascript. Javascript was very tough to grasp but with what was learned on the course coupled with the knowledge gained from all of the above and the tutorial videos they produced it slowly started to make sense. I reviewed several videos on building a quiz and took some ideas from different videos and applied them to my own. Any code that was used has been credited in comments in js files. The videos used for inspiration and where some code was acquired are listed below:

1. [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
    - I found myself on Stackoverflow so many times researching issues with javascript code or the occasional Html/CSS issue. This a fantastic place to learn and troubleshoot code.
1. [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-ie/)
    - After finishing the javascript essentials and Love Maths project it was very daunting sitting in front of an empty .js file. The people on Slack and especially my class mates were always willing to lend a hand and some of the mentors on there are just amazing.
