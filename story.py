NESSUS = '''
You see Nessus in the distance, the journey was quick and without
incident thank the lord for warp drive technology. Nessus has been
abandoned by humans since the darkness war, creatures of the
Darkness rome the land now. Commander Zavala has advised that
the light crystal may be in Sector 4 of Nessus, that is where you
will begin your search....

You land on the outskirts of Sector 4 to not alert any enemies,
the light crystal is believed to be located in the mines north
of Sector 4. To get there we can go through the (J)ungle pass
or the abandoned (V)illage....
'''

JUNGLE = '''
Jungle it is, the path is treacherous so you better be careful.
The sound of wildlife fills the air, Nessus was a paradise when
the humans first settled here but the Darkness changed all that.
Ahead you see an old outpost the jungle has covered it but the
door is still accessible. You could (I)nvestigate the
outpost or (C)ontinue on the jungle path.....
'''

JUNGLE_1 = '''
You continue on the path your legs are starting to get heavy,
the gravity on Nessus is nearly the same as on Earth but your body
feels heavier here it's probably time for a rest. You decide to set up
camp it is going to be nightfall soon. You set up camp in the Jungle
using the trees and bushes as cover. You reach into your pack and
pull out a food supplement package, as you eat you think of home
knowing if you don't complete this mission there might not be one
soon enough. This gravity is a bitch, you know you need to rest.
You have set up traps in a 3-meter radius so you layout down, you
can see the Nessus skyline peaking through the jungle it is beautiful.
Your eyes are getting heavier and heavier......
'''

JUNGLE_2 = '''
You jump up the blood rushes to your head, you are dizzy... what
was that? You spin around checking your sight lines, you hear
the darkness creatures approaching there are 3 voices maybe more.
You knew you would have to fight at some point nows the time
Guardian will you (F)ight or (S)urrender?
'''

SURRENDER = '''
You come out of cover with your hands up, the creatures surround you.
One of the larger creatures a Vandal speaks..... your universal
translater outputs their speech "You disappoint us Guardian, we
have no need for prisoners you would have been better off fighting..."
they raise their weapons and.......
'''

VILLAGE = '''
The village it is. The village has been abandoned for over a century,
it's weird to think there was a human colony here and all thats
left now are decrepit buildings and despair. You continue on
your path taking in the surroundings, in front of one of the
buildings you find an armored truck. You inspect the truck and
find a locked box, do you (O)pen the box or (C)ontinue on the
village path.....
'''

WEAPON_DEPOT = '''
You continue on your path silently to not alert any enemies,
there are so many buildings that the enemies could be hiding out in.
You see an old school in ruins it pains you to think kids used to play
happily here before the war, that feeling you keep with you it drives
you to succeed at this mission. You need to get off the road and rest
for a bit up ahead you see what looks to be an old weapon depot that
might be as good a spot as any. You enter the depot and scout the area
it looks abandoned you feel your body relax. You see there are 4 weapon
chests scattered around the room they might be worth checking....
'''

WEAPON_DEPOT_1 = '''
You approach the 4th chest near the back of your room hoping for more loot,
you try to open it but it seems to be stuck. You take your sword and place
it between the hinge, you push the sword upwards and......
'''

WEAPON_DEPOT_2 = '''
You are knocked back blinded by a flash of light, your ears are ringing,
it must have been a makeshift alarm using an old flash-bang grenade. Your
universal translator starts clicking in and out but suddenly you hear the
words "Come out guardian and face us".... There's no way out Guardian you have
two choices will you (F)ight or (S)urrender?
'''

ENCOUNTER_1 = '''
You enter the outpost it is so dark you can't see your hands in
front of you, you scramble around searching for the power switch
on the wall. The smell inside is unbearable there is something
going on here, your hand finally meets the switch you pull the
switch and light fills the.........
'''

ENCOUNTER_1A = '''
You take a step back to survey the room the creature lies slain
on the ground you see a sign saying service tunnel ahead. This
might lead the way to the mines but you need to move quickly there
may be more enemies ahead. You make your way down the corridor
quietly, you see the service tunnel door ahead. As you approach
your universal translator goes off "The guardian is mine....",
out of the shadows come 2 creatures armed to the teeth. Will
you (F)ight or (S)urrender?
'''

ENCOUNTER_2 = '''
You take the box off the truck, it is locked but that is not going
to stop you. You draw your sword and with one clean swoop, you knock
the lock straight off. You open the box carefully knowing anything could
be in there as the box is at least a century old, inside you find....
'''

ENCOUNTER_3 = '''
You gather yourself and grip your shield and sword, its time......
You push forward and you see 3 enemies the first steps up its a......
'''

ENCOUNTER_4 = '''
You get back to your feet and steady yourself, you tell yourself this
is for the people at home. You grip your shield tight and ready your
sword you walk out of the depot and see 4 enemies surrounding you,
without fear you point your sword at them - "Whos first?", the first
enemy steps up its a......
'''

ENCOUNTER_4A = '''
That was some battle, you took out 4 of the creatures but it took a
toll on your body you need to rest and recuperate. You drag their
bodies into the depot to avoid further detection. You board up the
entrance with the shelving units in the depot and lay down, your eyes
shut almost instantly......
'''

MINES_1 = '''
You have arrived at the entrance to the mines, two creatures of Darkness
stand guard you need to get past them to recover the crystal, you have no
other choices you need to take them out. You grip your sword and approach
the creatures, they immediately draw their weapons "You made a mistake
coming here Guardian....", the first enemy steps forward its a....
'''

MINES_2 = '''
Good job Guardian, you slayed those foul beasts. You enter the Mines and
are blown away by the sheer size of it there is a slender bridge in front
of you that leads to a large opening in the mine, you feel your getting
close to the crystal. You make your way across the bridge you are more
determined than ever suddenly your universal translator outputs "Silly,
wretched Guardian, you dare enter our mine..." in front of you 2 creatures
appear they came from the side of the bridge they must have been waiting
for you. "We have you now Guardian," says another voice you turn around
to find 2 more creatures slowly approaching weapons in hand... You are
surrounded Guardian will you (F)ight your way out or (S)urrender and hope
for the best?
'''

RECLAIM = '''
You move past the enemy bodies slain on the bridge and through the opening
in front of the bridge, inside the area you see a lot of machinery and in the
middle of the room floating 20 feet in the air is the Light Crystal. It looks
like the machines are sucking the power directly out of the crystal, you scan
the area for enemies but it is empty. You make your way toward the machines
slowly, suddenly bits of rock fall from above....
'''

RECLAIM_1 = '''
A massive creature jumps down from above and lands between you and the crystal.
'''

RECLAIM_2 = '''
The creature shouts "You will die today Guardian, you may have got past my
guards but the light will remain here with us". This is it Guardian this is
what you came here for, defeat this creature and you will reclaim the light.
The creature moves closer you can see it in full form it is massive at least
15 feet tall now you know it is the Darkness Commander...
