NESSUS = '''
You see Nessus in the distance, the journey was quick and without
incident thank the lord for warp drive technology. Nessus has been
abandoned by humans since the darkess war, creatures of the
Darkness rome the land now. Commander Zavala has advised that
the light crystal may be in Sector 4 of Nessus, that is where you
will begin your search....

You land on the outskirts of Sector 4 to not alert any enemies,
the light crystal is beleived to be located in the mines north
of Sector 4. To get there we can go through the (J)ungle pass
or the abandoned (V)illage....
'''

JUNGLE = '''
Jungle it is, the path is trecherous so you better be careful.
The sound of wildlife fills the air, Nessus was a paradise when
the humans first settled here but the Darkness changed all that.
Ahead you see an old outpost the jungle has covered it but the
door is still accessable. You could (I)nvestigate the
outpost or (C)ontinue on the jungle path.....
'''

JUNGLE_1 = '''
You continue on the path your legs are starting to get heavy,
the gravity on Nessus is nearly the same as Earth but your body
feels heavier here its probably time for a rest. You decide to setup
camp its going to be nightfall soon. You set up camp in the Jungle
using the trees and bushes as cover. You reach into your pack and
pull out a food suplement package, as you eat you think of home
knowing if you don't complete this mission there might not be one
soon enough. This gravity is a bitch, you know you need to rest.
You have setup traps in a 3 meter radius so you layout down, you
can see the Nessus skyline peaking through the jungle its beautiful.
You eyes are getting heavier and heavier......
'''

JUNGLE_2 = '''
You jump up the blood rushes too your head, you are dizzy... what
was that? You spin around checking your sight lines, you hear them
the darkness creatures approaching there are 3 voices maybe more.
You knew you would have to fight at some point nows the time
Guardian will you (F)ight or (S)urrender?
'''

SURRENDER = '''
You come out of cover with your hands up, the creatures surround you.
One of the larger creatures a Vandal speaks..... your universal
translater outputs their speech "You dissapoint us Guardian, we
have no need for prisoners you would have been better of fighting..."
they raise there weapons and.......

'''

VILLAGE = '''
Village it is. The village has been abandoned for over a century,
it's weird to think there was a human colony here and all thats
left now is decrepid buildings and dispair. You continue on
your path taking in the surroundings, in front of one of the
buildings you find an armoured truck. You inspect the truck and
find a locked box, do you (O)pen the box or (C)ontinue on the
village path.....
'''

WEPAON_DEPOT = '''
You continue you on your path silently as to not alert any enemies,
there are so many buildings that the enemies could be hiding out in.
You see and old school in ruins it pains you to think kids used to play
happily here before the war, that feeling you keep with you it drives
you to succeed at this mission. You need to get off the road and rest
for bit up ahead you see what looks to be an old wepaon depot that
might be as good a spot as any. You enter the depot and scout the area
it looks abandoned you feel your body relax. You see there are 4 weapon
chests scattered around the room they might be worth checking....
'''

WEPAON_DEPOT_1 = '''
You approach the 4th chest near the back of your room hoping for more loot,
you try to open it but it seems to be stuck. You take your sword and place
it between the hinge, you push the sword upwards and......
'''

WEPAON_DEPOT_2 = '''
You are knocked back blinded by a flash of light, your ears are ringing,
it must have been a make shift alarm using an old flash bang grenade. Your
universal translator starts clicking in and out but suddenly you hear the
words "Come out guardian and face us".... Theres no way out Guardian you have
two choices will you (F)ight or (S)urrender?
'''

ENCOUNTER_1 = '''
You enter the outpost its so dark you can't see your hands in
front of you, you scramble around searching for the power switch
on the wall. The smell inside is unbearable there is something
going on here, you hand finally meets the switch you pull the
switch and light fills the.........
'''

ENCOUNTER_1A = '''
You take a step back to survey the room the creature lays slain
on the ground you see a sign saying service tunnel ahead. This
might lead the way to the mines but I need to move quickly there
may be more enemies ahead. You make your way down the corridor
quietly, you see the service tunnel door ahead. As you approach
your universal tranlator goes off "They guardian is mine....",
out of the shadows comes 2 creatures armed to the teeth. Will
you (F)ight or (S)urrender?
'''

ENCOUNTER_2 = '''
You take the box off the truck, it is locked but that is not going
to stop you. You draw your sword and with one clean swoop you knock
the lock straight off. You open the box careful knowing anything could
be in there as the box is at least a century old, inside you find....

enemy steps up its a......
'''

ENCOUNTER_4A = '''
That was some battle, you took out 4 of the creatures but it took a
toll on your body you need to rest and recuperate. You drag their
bodys into the depot to avoid further detection. You board up the
entrance with the shelving units in the depot and lay down, your eyes
shut almost instantly......
