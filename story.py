incident thank the lord for warp drive technology. Nessus has been
abandoned by humans since the darkess war, creatures of the
Darkness rome the land now. Commander Zavala has advised that
the light crystal may be in Sector 4 of Nessus, that is where you
will begin your search....

You land on the outskirts of Sector 4 to not alert any enemies,
the light crystal is beleived to be located in the mines north
of Sector 4. To get there we can go through the (J)ungle pass
or the abandoned (V)illage....

JUNGLE = '''
Jungle it is, the path is trecherous so you better be careful.
The sound of wildlife fills the air, Nessus was a paradise when
the humans first settled here but the Darkness changed all that.

door is still accessable. You could (I)nvestigate the
outpost or (C)ontinue on the jungle path.....

JUNGLE_1 = '''
You continue on the path your legs are starting to get heavy,
the gravity on Nessus is nearly the same as Earth but your body
feels heavier here its probably time for a rest. You decide to setup
camp its going to be nightfall soon. You set up camp in the Jungle
using the trees and bushes as cover. You reach into your pack and
pull out a food suplement package, as you eat you think of home
knowing if you don't complete this mission there might not be one
soon enough. This gravity is a bitch, you know you need to rest.
You have setup traps in a 3 meter radius so you layout down, you
can see the Nessus skyline peaking through the jungle its beautiful.
You eyes are getting heavier and heavier......
